# Exmarket

Contributions are extremely welcomed! I am actively developing this project and appreciate any ideas, insights, and/or assistance. I would like to continue building and improving this project, making it a robust, highly available, and fault tolerant system that offers a simple interface for retrieving and processing Stock and Crypto data.

## Getting Started

To fix/add code to this project, first clone or fork the repository. Then, create a new branch to develop on. Make sure that your code meets the standards and follows the guidelines outlined by the Elixir Core team. Remember to run `mix format` if your code editor does not automatically format your code. Before submitting a pull request fix any issues discovered from running `mix credo`. Any new code should be commentted, if necessary, and include the applicable unit tests. Run the test suite with `mix test`.

Any new contributors (no matter how small) will be added to the official list of contributors for this project.
